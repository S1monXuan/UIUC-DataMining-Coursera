# Language and Environment
Python 3.9 Jupyter Notebook

# Package Used:
- mlxtend
- pandas
- numpy

# Score
94 / 100

# Estimated Reason
Since I uses Apriori Function from mlxtend, where uses fload instead of int. There may have some error when casting min support value (float) into real absolute support number (int).
